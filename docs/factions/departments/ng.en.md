## 11. Others

<span style="color:var(--pink);">11.1</span> If a faction member sends private messages (PMs) solely to disrupt a colleague, the member will be warned in advance by the leader to cease the PMs, and they will be ignored. Subsequent infractions will be punished with a <span style="color:red;">Faction Warn</span> and even <span style="color:red;">Dismissal</span> (if necessary).

<span style="color:var(--pink);">11.2</span> To join the National Guard, you need a Detective skill level of 5.

<span style="color:var(--pink);">11.3</span> Making negative generalizations about other departments or colleagues, regardless of existing issues, is prohibited. Violation of this rule will be sanctioned with a <span style="color:red;">Faction Warn</span> or <span style="color:red;">Dismissal</span>, depending on the circumstances and the number of previous infractions.

<span style="color:var(--pink);">11.4</span> Any player accepted to conduct tests must behave decently. If they insult or exhibit inappropriate behavior towards a faction member, they are automatically rejected without the right to conduct faction entry tests anymore.
