Anyone who violates this rule is sanctioned with a <span style="color:red;">Verbal Warning</span> or a <span style="color:red;">Faction Warn</span>, depending on the case. In the case of protests or players disrupting traffic, you are allowed to use water to calm them down.

<span style="color:var(--pink);">3.2</span> Make sure not to park your car over the spot where an FBI vehicle respawns or where suspects are arrested (<span style="color:red;">sanction: Verbal Warning</span> for the first offense, <span style="color:red;">Faction Warn</span> for the next).

<span style="color:var(--pink);">3.3</span> When you find a department vehicle: Infernus, Turismo, Bullet, NRG-500, Maverick, announce that you're taking it, for example: "[<span style="color:var(--pink);">/d</span>] Found a Bullet in the Fort Carson area, taking it."

## 4. Suspects

<span style="color:var(--pink);">4.1</span> FBI members have priority in capturing and arresting suspects with <span style="color:var(--pink);">wanted levels 3 and 4, as well as those without surrender rights</span> (exceptions to this rule are members of rank 4 and above who can go after any wanted). If there are no players with wanted levels 3 and 4 in the [<span style="color:var(--pink);">/wanted</span>] list, FBI members may engage in capturing/arresting players with wanted levels 1 and 2, and then 5 and 6. If a suspect with wanted level 1/2 or 5/6 surrenders (gets into a vehicle without being commanded), you should [<span style="color:var(--pink);">/cuff</span>] them, transport them to the nearest department HQ, and ask a PD or NG member if they will arrest them or if you should (<span style="color:red;">sanction: Faction Warn</span>).

!!! danger "Important"
    If there are no priority suspects for your department, take a screenshot with [<span style="color:var(--pink);">/wanted</span>] and proceed to capture a player who is not a priority at the wanted level. You have 5 minutes to capture any player while adhering to the basic rule. If the 5 minutes have passed, but you still managed to issue one or two warnings to the suspect, you can continue the pursuit. If not, check [<span style="color:var(--pink);">/wanted</span>] again and based on the available suspects, continue your activity.

<span style="color:var(--pink);">4.2</span> If a department member issues a wanted level to a player, they have the right to arrest them, regardless of the wanted level. If, before arresting them, the respective member logs out of the game, the suspect's custody reverts to the department that has priority over their wanted level.

<span style="color:var(--pink);">4.7</span> In the case of suspecting a player with a wanted level of possessing drugs, you are obligated to warn them by NAME, specify the department's name, and explain the reason in the warning, using the command [<span style="color:var(--pink);">/m</span>]. Example: "<span style="color:var(--pink);">Stop here! F.B.I. MaxyMusSs pull over, check! you risk wanted 2!</span>"

<span style="color:var(--pink);">4.8</span> Routine traffic checks (which involve stopping players driving vehicles) are only done with department vehicles. If the agent is on foot at the time of the check, and therefore when the warnings are issued, how the agent got there is irrelevant (<span style="color:red;">sanction: Faction Warn</span>).

<span style="color:var(--pink);">4.8.1</span> Before performing a routine check on players in a vehicle and ordering them to exit, you must ensure that they are present at the PC (moving or chatting) and have evidence to support this (<span style="color:red;">sanction: Faction Warn</span>).

<span style="color:var(--pink);">4.15</span> When confiscating a player's weapons, you are obliged to inform them of the reason. A simple text stating "<span style="color:var(--pink);">weapons in plain sight</span>" is sufficient (<span style="color:red;">sanction: Verbal Warning</span>).

<span style="color:var(--pink);">4.16</span> You are not allowed to confiscate a suspect's weapons if they do not have the right to surrender (<span style="color:red;">sanction: Faction Warn</span>).

## 8. Namecover

<span style="color:var(--pink);">8.1</span> The format for requesting a namecover is: ID | New Name | I don't have weapons, armor, and spray | Reason

!!! danger "Important"
    Namecover is a special command that can only be used by FBI department members. It is primarily used for extreme operations and to detect various crimes without arousing suspicion. Only agents with Rank 5+ have access to this command, and they can apply it to other members.

<span style="color:var(--pink);">8.2</span> It is forbidden for an FBI agent to reveal their identity in front of a civilian. Therefore, an agent undercover is not allowed to carry weapons. We will keep the command, as well as undercover operations, a secret (<span style="color:red;">sanction: Faction Warn</span>).

<span style="color:var(--pink);">8.3</span> It is strictly prohibited for the undercover agent to abuse their identity. Abuse can be defined as: senseless Death-Match, inappropriate language, etc. For various abuses of this kind, the respective member will be sanctioned with a <span style="color:red;">Faction Warn</span> or will be <span style="color:red;">dismissed</span> depending on the case.

<span style="color:var(--pink);">8.4</span> For evidence to be valid in the activity report, it must be shown that you are undercover. Take a screenshot at [<span style="color:var(--pink);">/frisk</span>] and another at [<span style="color:var(--pink);">/su</span>]. Screenshots using page-up are not considered valid.

!!! example "Example"
    A correct action: a screenshot when you receive the namecover (the request + the message when you received the namecover), a screenshot at [<span style="color:var(--pink);">/frisk</span>], a screenshot at [<span style="color:var(--pink);">/su</span>], a screenshot when you remove the namecover in a safe location.

<span style="color:var(--pink);">8.5</span> It is allowed for an undercover agent to buy drugs and even use them. This can lead to gaining trust from the trafficker. Additionally, the member with namecover can use NOS and Hydraulics, but not in an abusive manner.

<span style="color:var(--pink);">8.6</span> Undercover can also be used to issue wanted to civilians who break the law. This rule is especially for those of Rank 1 and addresses the following offenses:

- attacking a civilian (the civilian in question can even be you undercover).
- kidnapping a civilian (the civilian in question can even be you undercover).
- drive-by (shooting or running over).

<span style="color:var(--pink);">8.7</span> Namecover can also be used to detect those who intend to pickpocket you.

<span style="color:var(--pink);">8.8</span> FBI agents of Rank 5+ must take screenshots after each [<span style="color:var(--pink);">/namecover</span>] granted, and keep a record of the names granted (screenshots), in case it is needed (<span style="color:red;">sanction: Faction Warn</span>).

<span style="color:var(--pink);">8.9</span> Rank 5 members are required to announce through a message on the department chat [<span style="color:var(--pink);">/r</span>] when they use the [<span style="color:var(--pink);">/namecover</span>] command for each member (<span style="color:red;">sanction: Verbal Warning</span>).

<span style="color:var(--pink);">8.10</span> As an FBI member, you are allowed to possess a maximum of 50 grams of drugs at all times. However, drugs are only intended for use when you are on a namecover mission, as a civilian (example: to gain the trust of the suspect) (<span style="color:red;">sanction: Faction Warn</span>).

<span style="color:var(--pink);">8.11</span> In a namecover mission, it is strictly forbidden to use any skin mod (cskin, etc.) (<span style="color:red;">sanction: Faction Warn</span>).

<span style="color:var(--pink);">8.12</span> Post the namecover report for the current week only after the statistics for the previous week have been released (<span style="color:red;">sanction: Verbal Warning</span> for the first offense, <span style="color:red;">Faction Warn</span> for the next).

<span style="color:var(--pink);">8.13</span> You are allowed to use any name for namecover (Using a name for fun, indecent, very similar to other players/admins, or with an official clan tag is prohibited).

<span style="color:var(--pink);">8.14</span> You are not allowed to use [<span style="color:var(--pink);">/accept</span>], [<span style="color:var(--pink);">/admins</span>], [<span style="color:var(--pink);">/helpers</span>], or similar commands that clutter your chat when you are namecovered. If any of these commands or others appear in your screenshots, your namecover report will not be considered.

<span style="color:var(--pink);">8.15</span> Request namecover only in an interior (HQ or HOUSE). Use [<span style="color:var(--pink);">/undercover off</span>] only in an interior (HQ or HOUSE). Failure to comply with the rule will result in the cancellation of your namecover report and you will receive a <span style="color:red;">Faction Warn</span>.

<span style="color:var(--pink);">8.16</span> If the suspect with drugs logs out of the game or crashes, you need a video of a few seconds showing the message "the player is not connected."

<span style="color:var(--pink);">8.17</span> If the suspect you just sanctioned with wanted for "possession of drugs" no longer has the drugs on them, take a screenshot at [<span style="color:var(--pink);">/frisk</span>].

<span style="color:var(--pink);">8.18</span> You are not allowed to perform the namecover report on clan colleagues.

<span style="color:var(--pink);">8.19</span> If you have been promoted to Rank 2 Monday - Wednesday, you are required to compile the namecover report, and if you have been promoted Thursday - Sunday, you are exempt from posting the namecover report.

<span style="color:var(--pink);">8.19.1</span> If you have been promoted to Rank 4 Monday - Wednesday, you are exempt from posting the namecover report, and if you have been promoted Thursday - Sunday, you are required to compile the namecover report.

<span style="color:var(--pink);">8.20</span> When a member sets/receives an optional report, in that week, the member is exempt from the namecover report.

## 9. Forum Activity

<span style="color:var(--pink);">9.1</span> Forum activity is specific to those who reach Rank 5 and will be assigned to a specific topic together with other colleagues, taking turns.

<span style="color:var(--pink);">9.2</span> The individuals assigned for the respective week can be found in the topic "[Forum Activity](https://forum.b-zone.ro/topic/459201--)" and must post the statistics from that topic for the previous week.

<span style="color:var(--pink);">9.3</span> Individuals highlighted in green are required to post in their respective topic. With the current week specified at the top, and statistics must be posted for the previous week. Those highlighted in red must wait for their turn.

<span style="color:var(--pink);">9.4</span> The activity report log, activity requests, and attendance log are always posted on Sundays at the end of the week or at the latest on Wednesdays. The weekly mission and namecover report are always posted on Mondays at the beginning of the week.

<span style="color:var(--pink);">9.5</span> The sanction for not posting on time is a <span style="color:red;">Faction Warn</span>.
