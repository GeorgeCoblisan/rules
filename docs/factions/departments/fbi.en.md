## 2. Suspects

<span style="color:var(--pink);">2.1</span> FBI members have priority in capturing and arresting suspects with <span style="color:var(--pink);">wanted levels 3 and 4, as well as those without surrender rights</span> (exceptions to this rule are members of rank 4 and above who can go after any wanted). If there are no players with wanted levels 3 and 4 in the /wanted list, FBI members may engage in capturing/arresting players with wanted levels 1 and 2, and then 5 and 6. If a suspect with wanted level 1/2 or 5/6 surrenders (gets into a vehicle without being commanded), you should [/cuff] them, transport them to the nearest department HQ, and ask a PD or NG member if they will arrest them or if you should (<span style="color:red;">sanction: Faction Warn</span>).

!!! danger "Important"
    If there are no priority suspects for your department, take a screenshot with [<span style="color:var(--pink);">/wanted</span>] and proceed to capture a player who is not a priority at the wanted level. You have 5 minutes to capture any player while adhering to the basic rule. If the 5 minutes have passed, but you still managed to issue one or two warnings to the suspect, you can continue the pursuit. If not, check [<span style="color:var(--pink);">/wanted</span>] again and based on the available suspects, continue your activity.

<span style="color:var(--pink);">2.2</span> If a department member issues a wanted level to a player, they have the right to arrest them, regardless of the wanted level. If, before arresting them, the respective member logs out of the game, the suspect's custody reverts to the department that has priority over their wanted level.

You are not allowed to [<span style="color:var(--pink);">/uncuff</span>] them until the suspect reaches jail (exception: when the suspect possesses drugs and needs to get out of the car in the garage) (<span style="color:red;">sanction: Verbal Warning</span>).

<span style="color:var(--pink);">2.8</span> Routine traffic checks (which involve stopping players driving vehicles) are only done with department vehicles. If the agent is on foot at the time of the check, and therefore when the warnings are issued, how the agent got there is irrelevant (<span style="color:red;">sanction: Faction Warn</span>).

<span style="color:var(--pink);">2.8.1</span> Before performing a routine check on players in a vehicle and ordering them to exit, you must ensure that they are present at the PC (moving or chatting) and have evidence to support this (<span style="color:red;">sanction: Faction Warn</span>).

<span style="color:var(--pink);">2.15</span> When confiscating a player's weapons, you are obliged to inform them of the reason. A simple text stating "<span style="color:var(--pink);">weapons in plain sight</span>" is sufficient (<span style="color:red;">sanction: Verbal Warning</span>).

Instead, smoke grenades from 24/7 stores will only be confiscated in situations where they are used to abuse them / to create chaos (e.g., Protests in front of LS City Hall, and following an announcement on /gov requesting the cessation of their use if they are still used, then they can be confiscated).

<span style="color:var(--pink);">2.24</span> If the suspect without the right to surrender jumps on tall buildings using a bicycle (using the high jump bug), making it difficult to catch and kill them, you have the right to open fire with Hunter or Hydra to kill them. If the suspect comes down from the building, you are not allowed to open fire anymore, but you continue the ground pursuit. Make sure you always have clear evidence before opening fire! Failure to comply with this rule will result in a <span style="color:red;">Faction Warn</span> for the first offense, <span style="color:red;">Rank Down</span> for the second offense, and <span style="color:red;">Dismissal</span> if it continues.

<span style="color:var(--pink);">9.1</span> The format for requesting a namecover is: ID | New Name | I don't have weapons, armor, and spray | Reason

!!! danger "Important"
    Namecover is a special command that can only be used by FBI department members. It is primarily used for extreme operations and to detect various crimes without arousing suspicion. Only agents with Rank 5+ have access to this command, and they can apply it to other members.

<span style="color:var(--pink);">9.2</span> It is forbidden for an FBI agent to reveal their identity in front of a civilian. Therefore, an agent undercover is not allowed to carry weapons. We will keep the command, as well as undercover operations, a secret (<span style="color:red;">sanction: Faction Warn</span>).

<span style="color:var(--pink);">9.3</span> The given names must not be Non-RP names and must not imitate the names of various players / admins / leaders.

<span style="color:var(--pink);">9.5</span> For evidence to be valid in the activity report, it must be shown that you are undercover. Take a screenshot at [<span style="color:var(--pink);">/frisk</span>] and another at [<span style="color:var(--pink);">/su</span>]. Screenshots using page-up are not considered valid.

!!! example "Example"
    A correct action: a screenshot when you receive the namecover (the request + the message when you received the namecover), a screenshot at [<span style="color:var(--pink);">/frisk</span>], a screenshot at [<span style="color:var(--pink);">/su</span>], a screenshot when you remove the namecover in a safe location.

<span style="color:var(--pink);">9.6</span> It is allowed for an undercover agent to buy drugs and even use them. This can lead to gaining trust from the trafficker. Additionally, the member with namecover can use NOS and Hydraulics, but not in an abusive manner.

<span style="color:var(--pink);">9.7</span> Undercover can also be used to issue wanted to civilians who break the law. This rule is especially for those of Rank 1 and addresses the following offenses:

- attacking a civilian (the civilian in question can even be you undercover).
- kidnapping a civilian (the civilian in question can even be you undercover).
- drive-by (shooting or running over).
- killing a civilian (the civilian in question can even be you undercover).

<span style="color:var(--pink);">9.8</span> Namecover can also be used to detect those who intend to pickpocket you.

<span style="color:var(--pink);">9.11</span> As an FBI member, you are allowed to possess a maximum of 50 grams of drugs at all times. However, drugs are only intended for use when you are on a namecover mission, as a civilian (example: to gain the trust of the suspect) (<span style="color:red;">sanction: Faction Warn</span>).

<span style="color:var(--pink);">9.12</span> In a namecover mission, it is strictly forbidden to use any skin mod (cskin, etc.) (<span style="color:red;">sanction: Faction Warn</span>).

<span style="color:var(--pink);">9.13</span> Post the namecover report for the current week only after the statistics for the previous week have been released (<span style="color:red;">sanction: Verbal Warning</span> for the first offense, <span style="color:red;">Faction Warn</span> for the next).

<span style="color:var(--pink);">9.14</span> You are allowed to use any name for namecover (Using a name for fun, indecent, very similar to other players/admins, or with an official clan tag is prohibited).

<span style="color:var(--pink);">9.15</span> You are not allowed to use [<span style="color:var(--pink);">/accept</span>], [<span style="color:var(--pink);">/admins</span>], [<span style="color:var(--pink);">/helpers</span>], or similar commands that clutter your chat when you are namecovered. If any of these commands or others appear in your screenshots, your namecover report will not be considered.

<span style="color:var(--pink);">9.16</span> Request namecover only in an interior (HQ or HOUSE). Use [<span style="color:var(--pink);">/undercover off</span>] only in an interior (HQ or HOUSE). Failure to comply with the rule will result in the cancellation of your namecover report and you will receive a <span style="color:red;">Faction Warn</span>.

<span style="color:var(--pink);">9.17</span> If the suspect with drugs logs out of the game or crashes, you need a video of a few seconds showing the message "the player is not connected."

<span style="color:var(--pink);">9.18</span> If the suspect you just sanctioned with wanted for "possession of drugs" no longer has the drugs on them, take a screenshot at [<span style="color:var(--pink);">/frisk</span>].

<span style="color:var(--pink);">9.19</span> You are not allowed to perform the namecover report on clan colleagues.

## 11. Testers

<span style="color:var(--pink);">11.1</span> Members ranked between 4 and 6 (inclusive) are strictly prohibited from modifying the candidate's status to rejected/accepted without the leader's consent. Changing the player's status without the leader's approval is considered favoritism and is punishable by a <span style="color:red;">Faction Warn</span> for the first offense, and a <span style="color:red;">Rank Down</span> if it continues.

<span style="color:var(--pink);">11.2</span> Before starting a test, make sure the applicant's communications are closed. Once you use [<span style="color:var(--pink);">/ft</span>] on a player, their communications are usually automatically closed. The command [<span style="color:var(--pink);">/togcomms</span>] toggles communications open or closed.

<span style="color:var(--pink);">11.3</span> In recruitment cases where the candidate can be tested by any tester, a tester is not allowed to conduct tests with a player from the same clan/alliance (<span style="color:red;">sanction: RANK DOWN + Faction Warn</span>). The exception applies to the leader and subleaders, along with any special situations established by the leadership, in which this may be tolerated, applied immediately depending on the circumstances.

<span style="color:var(--pink);">11.4</span> In recruitment cases where each candidate is assigned one or more testers, testers are not allowed to test anyone other than the candidates they have been assigned to. The exception applies to Rank 6, who can test any candidate at any time (<span style="color:red;">sanction: RANK DOWN + removal from the testing position</span>).
