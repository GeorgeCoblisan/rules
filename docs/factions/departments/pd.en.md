### Roads

<span style="color:var(--pink);">6.2.1</span> The road team is primarily responsible for issuing fines and suspending players' driving licenses for violating traffic rules outlined in the Wanted & Ticket List topic.

<span style="color:var(--pink);">6.2.2</span> Members of the road team are prohibited from using the [<span style="color:var(--pink);">/confiscate</span>] command (drugs, weapons, materials, etc.) while using the [<span style="color:var(--pink);">/frisk</span>] command to check for alcohol levels; the sanction is a <span style="color:red;">Faction Warn!</span> If a player caught by radar possesses illegal items, this can be reported on [<span style="color:var(--pink);">/d</span>], and a SWAT colleague will handle it.

<span style="color:var(--pink);">6.2.3</span> A member of the road team is only allowed to arrest suspects whose wanted status has been granted by them or suspects who surrender to them voluntarily. In the latter case, it is necessary to ask on [<span style="color:var(--pink);">/d</span>] if you can take them. Additionally, they may respond by killing suspects who attack them (<span style="color:red;">sanction: Faction Warn</span>).

<span style="color:var(--pink);">6.2.4</span> A member of the road team is not allowed to pursue suspects without the right to surrender (even if they have given them a wanted status), regardless of rank.

<span style="color:var(--pink);">6.2.5</span> Members of the road team are prohibited from using their personal vehicle (for surveillance, issuing fines, etc.). They must use department vehicles for traffic-related actions (<span style="color:red;">sanction: Faction Warn</span>).

<span style="color:var(--pink);">6.2.6</span> They may use their personal vehicle only if they are rank 3+ and want to arrest a player to whom they have given a wanted status.

<span style="color:var(--pink);">6.2.8</span> If after 3 permission requests on [<span style="color:var(--pink);">/d</span>], with a minimum of 10 seconds between them, no response is received, the member may patrol.

<span style="color:var(--pink);">6.2.9</span> The member is required to provide evidence of the permission received or of the three requests (<span style="color:red;">sanction: Faction Warn</span>).

<span style="color:var(--pink);">6.2.10</span> The sanction for those who patrol in another city despite being refused by the department of that city, thus not having permission, is a <span style="color:red;">Faction Warn.</span>

<span style="color:var(--pink);">6.2.11</span> The only situation in which you can confiscate licenses in other cities without patrol approval is when you are passing through and can prove it. If your evidence does not prove that you were passing through, you receive a <span style="color:red;">Faction Warn.</span>

<span style="color:var(--pink);">6.2.12</span> You are not allowed to set up surveillance to confiscate licenses in other cities, under any circumstances (<span style="color:red;">sanction: Faction Warn</span>).

<span style="color:var(--pink);">6.2.14</span> You are not allowed to use evidence received from civilians; these will be considered invalid, and the officer will be sanctioned accordingly, that evidence being considered invalid.

<span style="color:var(--pink);">6.2.15</span> Sanctioning suspects without the right to surrender when they violate traffic rules is prohibited.

### SWAT

<span style="color:var(--pink);">6.3.1</span> The SWAT team is responsible for tracking and arresting suspects with wanted levels 1-2, killing suspects without the right to surrender (only rank 4+), searching players, and confiscating prohibited items (materials, drugs, and weapons) based on regulations.

<span style="color:var(--pink);">6.3.2</span> SWAT members are prohibited from setting up radar (<span style="color:red;">sanction: Faction Warn</span>).

<span style="color:var(--pink);">6.3.3</span> SWAT members are prohibited from carrying out road-related activities (confiscation, ticketing, etc.). If a SWAT member catches a player driving improperly, they can pass the evidence to a road team member! (<span style="color:red;">sanction: Faction Warn</span>).

<span style="color:var(--pink);">6.3.4</span> SWAT members ranked 3+ can pursue/arrest with almost any vehicle.

<span style="color:var(--pink);">6.3.5</span> Those ranked below 3 are prohibited from using anything other than department vehicles to pursue suspects with wanted levels. This rule applies only if the member is the DRIVER (<span style="color:red;">sanction: Faction Warn</span>).

<span style="color:var(--pink);">6.3.6</span> SWAT members ranked 4+ are allowed to pursue any suspect with a wanted level (regardless of the current level of wanted, right to surrender).

<span style="color:var(--pink);">6.3.7</span> Those ranked below 4 are prohibited from pursuing and arresting suspects with a wanted level higher than 2. They are required to focus on suspects with wanted levels 1-2, and if there are no wanted levels 1 and 2 in the Wanted List, a screenshot must be taken to prove this, and only then can pursuit of suspects with wanted levels 3 and 4, and then 5 and 6, be pursued (<span style="color:red;">sanction: Faction Warn</span>).

<span style="color:var(--pink);">6.3.8</span> Any evidence from a department member will be considered valid; evidence from civilians is invalid.

<span style="color:var(--pink);">6.3.9</span> Faction members ranked 5+ operate in both teams.

<span style="color:var(--pink);">6.3.10</span> SWAT members ranked 2-3 can pursue players with wanted levels granted by them, regardless of the wanted level, as long as they have the right to surrender.

## 7. Tickets

<span style="color:var(--pink);">7.1</span> If the fined player does not pay the fine on the spot (refuses or flees), the officer has the right to grant them the wanted level "<span style="color:var(--pink);">Not Paying Ticket</span>".

<span style="color:var(--pink);">7.2</span> If the player does not have enough money on hand to pay the fine, the officer is obliged to take them to an ATM or the bank to withdraw the necessary amount to pay the fine. If the player refuses, the officer has the right to grant them the wanted level "<span style="color:var(--pink);">Not Paying Ticket</span>". If the player does not have enough money in the bank, they will receive the wanted level for "<span style="color:var(--pink);">Not Paying Ticket</span>".

<span style="color:var(--pink);">7.3</span> You are not allowed to fine a player to whom you have given a wanted level 2 "<span style="color:var(--pink);">Disobeying Orders</span>". This rule also applies to players who leave the server and automatically receive wanted level 2 "<span style="color:var(--pink);">Disconnected While Wanted</span>" (<span style="color:red;">sanction: Faction Warn</span>).

<span style="color:var(--pink);">7.4</span> You are not allowed to fine players in Jail (<span style="color:red;">sanction: Faction Warn</span>).

<span style="color:var(--pink);">7.5</span> You are not allowed to give money to a player who does not have money to pay the fine (<span style="color:red;">sanction: Faction Warn</span>).

<span style="color:var(--pink);">7.5.1</span> If a player is level 7 but their actual level is higher than 7 (they have RP for level 8+), they will not be allowed to choose between the fine and license confiscation but will be sanctioned by a fine and license confiscation.

<span style="color:var(--pink);">7.6</span> Any officer caught violating traffic rules will pay the corresponding fine.

<span style="color:var(--pink);">7.6.1</span> Any officer reported for violating traffic rules will pay a fine specified on the forum, in the Fines topic, where you can find this issue detailed. If they do not pay it within 48 hours, they receive a <span style="color:red;">Faction Warn.</span>

<span style="color:var(--pink);">7.6.2</span> Department members are not allowed to drive recklessly and intentionally disturb other traffic participants (examples: intentionally hitting other drivers multiple times, blocking the road, etc.) (<span style="color:red;">sanction: Faction Warn</span>).

## 8. Driving

<span style="color:var(--pink);">8.1</span> Driving is considered improper when the player drives on the opposite lane for at least 3 seconds. If the player does not return to the correct lane during these seconds, the officer has the right to pull them over and sanction them. This rule also applies if the player uses the sand, grass, or other textures alongside the road. They cannot be used to avoid the correct lane.

<span style="color:var(--pink);">8.2</span> Driving is considered proper when it stays entirely within their lane or even when it slightly crosses onto the opposite lane.

<span style="color:var(--pink);">8.2.1</span> Driving is still considered proper when it cuts across lanes at a 90-degree angle.

<span style="color:var(--pink);">8.2.2</span> It is also considered proper driving when using grass, sand, etc., from the correct lane.

<span style="color:var(--pink);">8.3</span> Intentionally hitting other players repeatedly with their vehicle is considered obstructing other traffic participants or disturbing traffic.

<span style="color:var(--pink);">8.4</span> If you catch a department member driving on the wrong side (with a civilian car), you cannot confiscate their driver's license. Pull them over and take a screenshot with [<span style="color:var(--pink);">/wanted</span>], and if they claim to be chasing a non-surrender suspect, you are obligated to verify. If they are not chasing a non-surrender suspect, you give them a specific fine, which they must accept. Otherwise, you can report them via PM to their leader, and they will be sanctioned with a <span style="color:red;">Faction Warn.</span>

<span style="color:var(--pink);">8.5</span> If you catch a department member violating traffic rules while off-duty, you are obligated to pull them over and issue them a specific fine. If they do not stop after three warnings or refuse to pay the fine, you can file a complaint via PM to their leader, and they will be sanctioned with a <span style="color:red;">Faction Warn.</span>

<span style="color:var(--pink);">8.6</span> You are not allowed to suspend a driver's license for reasons other than those provided in the general department regulations and Wanted & Ticket List.

<span style="color:var(--pink);">8.7</span> You can confiscate the license of an AFK player in jail only if you have explained the reasons beforehand.

<span style="color:var(--pink);">8.8</span> You can confiscate the license of a player in jail as long as they are not AFK and you explain the reason for the suspension on the spot. In this case, you are obliged to specify the date, time, and location where the offense was committed.

<span style="color:var(--pink);">8.9</span> An officer sanctioning a player administratively is obliged to communicate the committed offense, the approximate area where it occurred, and the sanction to be applied. If the offense was committed at a different time or even on a different day, the officer is obliged to communicate, in addition to all the details mentioned earlier, the day and time when the player was caught breaking the law (<span style="color:red;">sanction: Verbal Warning</span>).

<span style="color:var(--pink);">8.9.1</span> If the suspect is administratively sanctioned within 10 minutes of committing the offense, the officer is no longer obliged to communicate any details, as the offense is recent enough for the player to know what they did. An exception to this rule is for players in jail (following the provisions mentioned in points 6.7 and 6.8).

<span style="color:var(--pink);">8.10</span> A member is not allowed to sanction a Tow Truck Company member who is in the process of towing a vehicle and has their beacon on (<span style="color:red;">sanction: Faction Warn</span>).

<span style="color:var(--pink);">8.11</span> A member is not allowed to sanction a Paramedics member who is on a mission with their beacon on. If you believe they are not truly on a mission, you can pull them over, and in case of potential abuse, they will be reported to their leader (<span style="color:red;">sanction: Faction Warn</span>).

<span style="color:var(--pink);">8.12</span> If a paramedic is caught violating traffic rules while transporting a corpse with a <span style="color:var(--pink);">Paramedic Romero and the beacon is not visibly on</span>, the officer is obliged to verify if the paramedic is indeed dealing with the corpse. The verification process involves following the paramedic to their current destination (pickup or delivery point of the corpse). If it is proven that the paramedic abused the beacon to drive improperly, the officer is permitted to report them on the website.

## 9. Parking

<span style="color:var(--pink);">9.1</span> Improper parking is considered when a player leaves their vehicle in the middle of the road for more than 5 seconds. If a player is instructed to pull over, the officer is obliged to guide them to park properly on the right side, where there is space and does not obstruct other traffic participants (e.g., on the sidewalk, on the right side of the highway, on the right side of the tunnel, etc.).

<span style="color:var(--pink);">9.2</span> If the player refuses to park properly, then the officer has the right to sanction them. Also considered improper parking is when a player parks in the middle of the road while at the wheel for more than 60 seconds.

## 10. The Radar

<span style="color:var(--pink);">10.1</span> Players who exceed the minimum speed limit (100, 130, or 160 km/h) <span style="color:var(--pink);">by 1 - 2 km/h</span> will not be penalized.

<span style="color:var(--pink);">10.2</span> When setting up/resuming a radar, regardless of the city you are in, you are obligated to announce it on the department chat, [<span style="color:var(--pink);">/d</span>].

<span style="color:var(--pink);">10.3</span> Before setting up a radar in a certain area, you must ask three times on [<span style="color:var(--pink);">/d</span>] if the area is clear, and if the area is not in your city, you must request permission from a rank 4+ on [<span style="color:var(--pink);">/d</span>]. If you do not receive a response or are refused, you must wait 5 minutes before making another request.

<span style="color:var(--pink);">10.3.1</span> You are obligated to have evidence of the permission received. If you do not have it, it will be considered that you set up the radar without permission and you will receive a <span style="color:red;">Faction Warn.</span>

<span style="color:var(--pink);">10.3.2</span> If a rank lower than 4 grants you the right to set up radar in another city, you will do so at your own risk, and you may be penalized as if you did not have evidence for the radar.

<span style="color:var(--pink);">10.4</span> Vehicles equipped with radar systems are: PD Car, Police Infernus, HPV-1000, and PD NRG-500.

## 11. Summons

<span style="color:var(--pink);">11.1</span> Any summoning must be issued in the name of the players.

<span style="color:var(--pink);">11.2</span> If you need to pull over a player who has a wanted level, you are obligated to use [<span style="color:var(--pink);">/m</span>], following the rules above (<span style="color:red;">sanction: Faction Warn</span>).

<span style="color:var(--pink);">11.3</span> If a player WITHOUT a wanted level is a passenger in a vehicle and needs to be sanctioned for a misdemeanor, first pull over the driver, then, after they have stopped, instruct the passenger to exit. If they refuse to exit, grant them a wanted level for disobeying orders.

<span style="color:var(--pink);">11.4</span> If a player is instructed to exit a vehicle and fails to comply, grant them Wanted 2 "<span style="color:var(--pink);">Disobeying orders</span>".

<span style="color:var(--pink);">11.5</span> A person instructed to pull over by a police officer is required to park properly on the right side, otherwise, their license may be confiscated for improper parking.

## 12. Treating Civilians

<span style="color:var(--pink);">12.1</span> Any player who is not part of a department is considered a civilian.

<span style="color:var(--pink);">12.2</span> You are not allowed to kill a civilian if they request it or for you to ask to be killed by a civilian. You can only request this from a colleague in departments or commit suicide (<span style="color:red;">sanction: Faction Warn</span>).

<span style="color:var(--pink);">12.3</span> If a player remains motionless and unresponsive (AFK without an hourglass) when prompted to exit the vehicle, accept the license presentation request [<span style="color:var(--pink);">/requestlicenses</span>], pay a fine, or surrender, you must wait 30 seconds from the last prompt before proceeding with the appropriate sanction (<span style="color:red;">sanction: Faction Warn</span>).

!!! example "Exceptions"
    If a player is in a vehicle parked correctly, not violating any rules, and is not moving (AFK without an hourglass), the officer does NOT have the right to prompt them to exit until the player moves again.<br/>
    If a player who is not violating any rules remains motionless on the ground (e.g., is AFK without an hourglass at CNN), the officer is NOT allowed to request their licenses until the player moves again.

    For both exceptions, if the officer has evidence that the player has recently moved or written in the chat and intentionally went AFK to avoid sanctioning, they can proceed normally while adhering to the main rule above.

<span style="color:var(--pink);">12.4</span> Routine traffic checks (involving stopping players driving vehicles) are only conducted using department vehicles. If the officer is on foot at the time of conducting the check, implicitly at the time of issuing warnings, how the officer arrived there is irrelevant (<span style="color:red;">sanction: Faction Warn</span>).

<span style="color:var(--pink);">12.5</span> If a player refuses to exit the vehicle for a routine check after being prompted at least 3 times, they will receive Wanted 2 for "<span style="color:var(--pink);">Disobeying Orders</span>". Furthermore, if the suspect exits when prompted to surrender, and after using [<span style="color:var(--pink);">/frisk</span>] you notice they are in possession of drugs, you have the right to give them Wanted 3 for drug possession (totaling Wanted 5). If they are handcuffed and you need to confiscate the drugs, you can use [<span style="color:var(--pink);">/eject</span>] and then [<span style="color:var(--pink);">/confiscate</span>] at the department garage.

## 13. Wanted Suspects

<span style="color:var(--pink);">13.1</span> The PDs deal with suspects with wanted levels 1 and 2 with the right to surrender.

<span style="color:var(--pink);">13.2</span> A police officer can arrest a suspect to whom they have given a wanted level, regardless of the level of wanted, provided they have the right to surrender.

<span style="color:var(--pink);">13.3</span> You are not allowed to pursue suspects with wanted levels 3+ who have the right to surrender if you did not give them the wanted level (<span style="color:red;">sanction: Faction Warn</span>).

<span style="color:var(--pink);">13.4</span> A police officer with a rank lower than 4 has the obligation that when a suspect with a wanted level of 3+ comes and surrenders to them, to handcuff them [<span style="color:var(--pink);">/cuff</span>], then announce on [<span style="color:var(--pink);">/d</span>] the suspect's ID, wanted level, and approximate location. The suspect will be handed over to whoever requests it on [<span style="color:var(--pink);">/d</span>]. You can only arrest the suspect with the consent of those responsible for them. If nobody responds on the department chat after asking three times, you have the right to arrest the suspect.

<span style="color:var(--pink);">13.5</span> The police officer has the obligation to hand over a suspect to another police officer if the latter has prompted them beforehand.

<span style="color:var(--pink);">13.6</span> Police officers are obligated to patrol only with department vehicles.

<span style="color:var(--pink);">13.7</span> Police officers of rank 1-2 are obligated to make arrests only with department vehicles.

<span style="color:var(--pink);">13.8</span> When taking a suspect into custody, you are obligated to use [<span style="color:var(--pink);">/cuff</span>].

<span style="color:var(--pink);">13.9</span> Suspects with the right to surrender lose their rights when they attack you at least 4 times with fists or shoot at you with at least 1 bullet.

<span style="color:var(--pink);">13.10</span> If you are attacked or killed by a suspect, regardless of your location (Jail/HQ/Garage/Other area), the suspect will receive wanted level 3 - "<span style="color:var(--pink);">Cop Attack</span>", respectively wanted level 5 - "<span style="color:var(--pink);">Cop Kill</span>".

<span style="color:var(--pink);">13.11</span> If a suspect (with the right to surrender) is AFK with a wanted level (on ESC), you warn them, announce on [<span style="color:var(--pink);">/d</span>] that they are AFK specifying the exact time, including seconds, and after 3 minutes (180 seconds), you can kill them.

<span style="color:var(--pink);">13.12</span> If the suspect remains motionless when asked to surrender (provided that they are found standing still and remain still after being warned), the officer must wait for 30 seconds before having the right to kill them.

<span style="color:var(--pink);">13.13</span> When arresting a suspect, you are obligated to take them to the nearest prison. For example, if you apprehend a suspect in the city of Los Santos, you must take them to the prison at LSPD. You are not allowed to transport them to prisons in other cities.

<span style="color:var(--pink);">13.14</span> When a player has been caught by radar or any other offense that leads to the confiscation of their driver's license, and their license is not immediately confiscated but instead they receive a wanted level, they can receive [<span style="color:var(--pink);">/eject</span>] in the garage of a department to have their license confiscated before being arrested.

Observations:

- If the suspect does not respond when asked to surrender, then the officer has the right (only) to kill them.
- If the suspect says they do not surrender, then the officer has the right (only) to kill them.
- If the suspect says they surrender and then flees on foot from the officer, then the officer has the right (only) to kill them.
- If the suspect initially says they do not surrender or flees on foot from the officer, and then changes their mind and wishes to surrender, then the officer has the right (only) to kill them.
- If the suspect says they surrender, and then attacks the officer, then the officer has the right (only) to kill them.
- If the suspect says they do not surrender and flees in a vehicle, then the officer has the right to give them wanted for "<span style="color:var(--pink);">Runner</span>".
- If the suspect does not respond when asked to surrender and flees in a vehicle, then the officer has the right to give them wanted for "<span style="color:var(--pink);">Runner</span>".
