- rank 1 members do not have the right to inactivity.
- rank 2 members are entitled to a maximum of one week of inactivity.
- rank 3+ members are entitled to a maximum of two weeks of inactivity.

!!! example "Info note"
    Members with approved inactivity requests are allowed to connect to the server and play. They will be exempt from the activity report.<br/>
    <span style="color:var(--pink);">Inactivity requests cannot be made for the current reporting week, only for the following weeks.</span>

### Activity Report

        - this means that in the following reporting week, they will need to recover the unfinished points from the previous week in addition to the points they need to collect from the current report.

    - if the player fails to finalize the report even during the recovery week, they will be sanctioned as follows:
        - players of <span style="color:var(--green);">rank 2</span> will be <span style="color:red;">automatically dismissed with FP 10/60.</span>
        - players of <span style="color:var(--green);">at least rank 3</span> will receive <span style="color:red;">initial rank down,</span> and if they still do not complete their report, they will be <span style="color:red;">automatically dismissed with FP 10/60.</span>

### Hours Played

All faction members are required to have a minimum of real hours played within a month. The number of hours and sanctions for their absence can be found in [Leader Rules -> Member Activity](../leaders/leader-rules.md/#member-activity).

Players with a minimum seniority of one year in the faction, who have shown seriousness and involvement, are eligible, upon their request, <span style="color:var(--green);">to be exempted</span> from the requirement to accumulate real hours played in a specific month.

This benefit <span style="color:var(--pink);">can be used only once a year</span> and will only exempt you from the requirement of played hours, not from submitting activity reports for that month.

Colleagues can be reported to the leader via a private message on the forum. The leader can be reported to the admins [by opening a ticket on the website](https://www.rpg.b-zone.ro/ticket).

Colleagues also include members of the same type of factions for taxi, instructors, and departments.

### Proofs

A proof is valid for a maximum of 3 days (<span style="color:var(--pink);">invalid proofs</span>). You have 24 hours to provide evidence in your defense, except when you have an inactivity request. In this case, you have 24 hours after the expiration of inactivity to present the evidence.

- for witnesses added by the <span style="color:var(--green);">ACCUSED</span> as well as for the accused (the faction member who is reported): they will be sanctioned with <span style="color:red;">Verbal Warning</span> for minor things or <span style="color:red;">Faction Warn</span> for more serious matters, in addition to the sanction they should receive for the complaint if they were guilty of something.

## 6. Removing Sanctions

Sanctions such as <span style="color:red;">Verbal Warning</span> and <span style="color:red;">Faction Warn</span> can be manually removed by the leader when they deem it appropriate, respecting the minimum waiting period, or automatically by the server.

## 7. Rank Promotion

Rank promotion can be done manually by the leader when they deem it appropriate, respecting the minimum periods, or automatically by the server.

The minimum durations for rank promotion can be viewed in [Leader Rules -> Member Promotion and Faction Slots](../leaders/leader-rules.md/#7-member-promotion-and-faction-slots).

The Subleader rank is assigned by the leader when they deem it appropriate, respecting [Leader Rules -> Choosing Subleaders](../leaders/leader-rules.md/#choosing-subleaders).

!!! example "Info note"
    If you are demoted from Subleader, you will receive a rank based on your total seniority in the faction. For the next promotion, counting will start from the moment you lost the Subleader position.

In special cases, <span style="color:var(--pink);">Faction Punish 60 may be granted to members who have been in the faction for over 2 weeks.</span>

- members with bans who somehow manage to enter a faction will always be dismissed with FP 60/60.
- members who abuse their position (granting licenses to themselves before being dismissed, intentionally providing multiple false news, etc.) will always be dismissed with <span style="color:red;">FP 60/60 and banned for 14 days</span> for this.

!!! danger "Important"
    If you have received a ban of 3 days or more, you will only be able to remain in the faction if you are unbanned through an unban request, not if you purchase an unban with gold.

!!! example "Info note"
    Blacklisting will not be granted to departments for things that can be sanctioned with a wanted status. </br>
    One warning will be issued for each offense.

### Paying the Blacklist

- faction players on the blacklist have 72 hours, if they do not have an inactivity request, to pay the blacklist fee. Otherwise, they will be initially sanctioned with <span style="color:red;">Verbal Warning</span>, and if the blacklist fee is not paid within the next 24 hours, the member will be <span style="color:red;">dismissed.</span>
- the blacklist fee is paid on the website or directly in-game through specific commands, without giving the money to a member of that faction.
- once the payment has been made, the player will be automatically removed from the blacklist.
- it is forbidden for faction members to ask or accept money for the blacklist instead of informing the player to use the appropriate commands (<span style="color:red;">sanction: dismissal</span>).

## 10. Others

### Tester Status

This status is assigned by the leader to members of at least rank 4 when they deem it appropriate.

Members with this status are obligated to respect [Leader Rules -> Testing Candidates](../leaders/leader-rules.md/#testing-candidates), and will be sanctioned accordingly for any violations.

### Multiple Accounts and Shared IP

Members with multiple accounts (those who own more than one account) are not allowed to have more than one account in the same faction.

Three different days (IN THE LAST 7 DAYS) of logs (SA:MP Login) are sufficient to determine that 2 members from the same faction frequently share their account. In this situation, we will consider them players with multiple accounts in the same faction and both accounts will be dismissed.

!!! danger "Important"
    For players who play from the same location and share a common IP, in order for both to be part of the same faction, it is necessary to [open a ticket on the RPG website](https://www.rpg.b-zone.ro/ticket) to perform some checks and allow this to happen.

### Jobs

You can hold any type of legal or illegal job.

The leader has the right to force members to use a certain job for a specific period of time in order to carry out faction work (<span style="color:red;">sanction: Faction Warn</span>).

### Skins

Wearing a skin other than the one corresponding to your rank/job without the leader's approval is sanctioned (<span style="color:red;">sanction: Verbal Warning</span> for the first offense, <span style="color:red;">Faction Warn</span> if it persists).

### Absences

If a mandatory activity is organized within the faction, the only place where you can request absence is on the RPG website through an absence request.

### Exceptions

We reserve the right to make exceptions to these rules. In certain cases, the sanctions may be different.<br/>
These exceptions can only be made with the permission of an Admin 6.
