<span style="color:var(--pink);">10.2</span> The Leader chooses which rank 4+ member to assign as a tester. Getting rank 4 does not guarantee obtaining the tester role.

<span style="color:var(--pink);">10.3</span> Faction testers are strictly prohibited from marking accepted players to "Under Testing" status after they pass the tests, meaning they are not allowed to invite them (from rank 0 to rank 1) (<span style="color:red;">sanction: Faction Warn + removal of Tester status</span>).
