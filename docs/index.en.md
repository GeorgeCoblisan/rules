# B-Zone SA:MP Rules

## 1. Accounts

The owner of an account is always considered to be the possessor of the email address registered on the account. For security reasons make sure you do not lose access to the account's email address, otherwise it is lost.

The staff offers limited help via [the recovery system](https://www.rpg.b-zone.ro/account/recoverAccount) on the RPG website and does not guarantee the recovery of a lost account. We reserve our right to reject recoveries  without offering any reason.

!!! example "Info note"
    All punishments will be given depending on the real level of the player (meaning we will calculate the respect points of the player to determinate their real level).

### Accounts/Goods Businesses
We do not allow businesses or attempts of businesses with real goods for game goods (<span style="color:red;">punishment: permanent ban</span>).

We do not allow businesses or attempts of businesses with gold for game goods (<span style="color:red;">punishment: ban 30 days</span>).

We do not allow businesses or attempts of businesses that involve creating multiple clans and selling them overpriced after they get older than a month (<span style="color:red;">punishment: ban 30 days</span>).

We do not allow businesses or attempts of businesses with accounts for real or game goods (<span style="color:red;">punishment: permanent ban without the right to buy shop unban</span>).

!!! danger "Important"

    The second offence is punished <span style="color:red;">directly with permanent ban without the right to buy shop unban</span>.

    Due to the multitude of players who violate these rules, we reserve the right to hold accountable and sanction transfers or businesses that have no logical reasoning or justification.

### Account Security
The staff does not handle problems regarding hacked accounts, stolen goods, punishments received while your account was hacked and so on. It is your duty to take care of your account or your email address.
Sharing an account with other people may lead to such probems and you risk remaining without an account, goods or get punished because of this.

Recovering a lost account can only be done by [a recovery request](https://www.rpg.b-zone.ro/account/recoverAccount) on the website, by clicking the Sign In button and then on Lost your account. Read the rules that show up carefully when trying to recover an account.

!!! example "Info note"

    Level 4+ admins reserve their right to punish someone who hacks accounts or to help someone with a hacked account if they consider necessary. 

    Attention, admins have absolutely no obligation to punish someone or help you if your account got hacked.

??? warning "Examples of ways your account can get hacked"

    - sharing your password/PIN with others.
    - using easily guessable password and PIN.
    - not activating 2FA (two-factor authentication) on your account.
    - having your email address compromised.
    - entering your password and PIN in places other than our SA-MP server or our server's website.
    - clicking on unknown links.
    - downloading unknown files.

??? success "Preventing account hacking"
    - the most important prevention method by far is activating 2FA, details on how to do this can be found below.
    - do not share your account password/PIN with anyone under any circumstances.
    - use a password that is at least 10 characters long, contains at least 1 uppercase letter that is not the first letter, at least 1 digit, and at least 1 symbol (ex: andr3!Pl4yB!g).
    - secure your email address using the same tips as securing your sa-mp account, and activate 2FA there as well.
    - do not use or enter your password and PIN on servers or websites that do not belong to us. We will never organize giveaways where you need to enter your account password. Those are 100% scams. These websites are known as phishing sites. Find more information online.
    - do not click on links that you do not recognize as completely safe. Clicking on some links may take you to websites that contain cookie stealers (which connect someone else to your accounts stored in your browser) or automatically install various viruses.
    - do not download or accept files that you do not fully trust as being clean. You could receive a file from a friend that contains viruses. You could download a mod or modpack that contains viruses. Not everything you find on the internet or receive from others is clean. If you need mods, we advise you to download them only from our forum from [the mods section](https://forum.b-zone.ro/files/), where they are verified before being approved there.

    #### <span style="font-size: 25px !important; color: #ff5500 !important; border-top: 1px solid #424657 !important; padding-top: 7px !important;">2FA Activation Tutorial</span>

    In short, 2FA is an additional application on your phone that generates a 6-digit code that changes periodically. That code will be used to log in to your account when the calendar day changes or when your IP changes.

    <span style="color:red;">Important to know:</span> if you do not have 2FA activated and someone logs into your account, that person can activate 2FA and lock you out of your account. Another thing you need to know is that if your email address is compromised, the person who compromised it can use it to gain access to 2FA on the sa-mp server, so be careful with your email and set a valid email on your account.

    For enhanced protection, 2FA is mandatory for individuals holding positions on the server (leader, helper, admin) and they will not be able to use their accounts without having it activated.

    If you deactivate 2FA after activating it, the old entry in the app will no longer work. You must use the entry from the app created at the time of 2FA reactivation.

    In case of loss or reset of your phone, or deletion of the app, the secret key with which you can regain access to 2FA can be recovered using our [2FA recovery system](https://www.rpg.b-zone.ro/account/recoverTOTP) on our website.

    1. <span style="color:var(--green);">Activating 2FA</span> is done on the RPG website, by going to My Account and then to Security. Click on the activation button.
    <figure markdown="span">
        ![2FA activation](images/2FA-activate.png){ width="800" }
        <figcaption>2FA Activation</figcaption>
    </figure>

    2. A window will open with a QR code and a secret key. Read the instructions carefully and download the desired 2FA application. Do not close the window!<br/>
    You can use Google Authenticator, Authy, or another preferred application.<br/>
    Tip: Save that long code (the secret key) somewhere in case you lose access to your account's email.
    <figure markdown="span">
        ![2FA activation window](images/2FA-window.png){ width="500" }
        <figcaption>2FA Activation Window</figcaption>
    </figure>

    3. After installing the desired application, look for the add button and select the desired option: scan the QR code or manually enter the secret key (that long code).
    <figure markdown="span">
        ![adding a new entry](images/2FA-new-entry.png){ width="250" }
        <figcaption>Adding a New Entry</figcaption>
    </figure>

    4. If you opted for the QR code scanning method, then all you have to do is point your phone's camera at the QR code on the RPG website. The phone will automatically recognize the QR code and add a new entry to the application.
    <figure markdown="span">
        ![scanning the QR code](images/2FA-qr-scan.png){ width="250" }
        <figcaption>Scanning the QR Code</figcaption>
    </figure>

    5. If you opted for manual entry, enter the desired name for the entry, copy the secret key (that long code) into the application exactly as it is, including uppercase letters, lowercase letters, and numbers. Also, leave the "Time Based" option checked because the codes only work based on that.
    <figure markdown="span">
        ![manual entry](images/2FA-manual-entry.png){ width="250" }
        <figcaption>Manual Entry</figcaption>
    </figure>

    6. The final step is to add the code generated by the new entry in the application to the window on the RPG website. Enter the code there, without spaces, and click the <span style="color:var(--green);">Activate</span> button to activate your 2FA.
    <figure markdown="span">
        ![final activation](images/2FA-final-activation.png){ width="500" }
        <figcaption>Final Activation</figcaption>
    </figure>

    7. <span style="color:red;">Deactivating 2FA</span> is also done from My Account, going to Security and clicking on the deactivation button.<br/>
    You will not be able to deactivate 2FA without access to the code generated by the application with which 2FA was initially activated.
    <figure markdown="span">
        ![2FA deactivation](images/2FA-deactivate.png){ width="800" }
        <figcaption>2FA Deactivation</figcaption>
    </figure>

    8. In the window that opens, you will need to enter the code generated by the application and click the green button. You will then receive a success message and see that 2FA is deactivated.
    <figure markdown="span">
        ![final deactivation](images/2FA-final-deactivation.png){ width="500" }
        <figcaption>Final Deactivation</figcaption>
    </figure>

    At this point, 2FA on your account is completely deactivated, so the risk of compromise is higher. Remember that it is your responsibility to ensure the correct security of your account.

### Multiple Accounts
You can own multiple accounts, but breaking some rules like: illegal businesses, stealing accounts, cheating, forbidden mods, bug abuse, advertising, scamming, language, toxicity, repeated rule breaking, other severe rule breaking can be punished on all accounts you own.

### Account Sharing
Sharing an account with another person is allowed but will be done <span style="color:red;">on your own accord.</span>

!!! danger "Important"

    For bans of at least 14 days we will punish secondary accounts with a higher level than the banned account when one of these conditions are met:

    - when they share in at least 3 different days common IPs for the last week since the punishment was given.
    - have the same email address and the account has been recently active in-game (past month).
    - at the moment of the punishment share the same IP.

    In certain situations the staff can ban secondary accounts that do not apply in this rule with the approval of a level 6 admin.

It is strictly forbidden for members of the RPG team (leaders, helpers, admins) to share their accounts with other people without informing and discussing with the Supervisor or Manager beforehand. The consequence for breaking this rule is removing you from your position or even banning your account if needed.

### Server Activity
Any method of accumulating hours played, leaving the AFK state, automizing actions for you, etc. (autoclickers, blocking keys, route recording mods or other mods, riding accounts in/on cars, abusing the poker system, etc.). This also means controlling secondary accounts in any way, usually by using mods.

Admins will interract with you directly or indirectly, where it is necessary, in order to ensure that you are actually moving the character in game, and if they determine you broke the rule you will get <span style="color:red;">punished with ban 1 day, or more</span> with the approval of a higher level admin for multiple offenses, as well as deleting certain prizes you might have received.

!!! danger "Important"
    In case of advanced mods (that answer automatically, that send warnings when an admin checks, that auto moves the character, that automates actions in your place, etc.) will receive <span style="color:red;">a higher punishment</span> because the verification process is more complicated. The punishment will be etablished by the admins, depending on the case.

We will no longer accept mocking responses to admins who try to determine if you are active on the account. Our purpose is to make sure that you play fair and respect the systems we offer, so don't complicate things.

We also offer players to check and report other players if they catch them using such methods.

As long as you play normally, you move the account, one at a time and don't use methods to explicitly grow your activity abusively, you shouldn't have any fear and the rules above don't apply to you. They are intended for players that try to explicitly abuse, not players who play normally.

### Inactivity
Players that do not have at least 20 REAL hours played in the last 2 months risk losing their house or shares to all owned businesses (no vehicles).

Players with houses bought from the shop need at least 10 REAL hours in the last 2 months not to lose them.

If you cannot play we suggest selling your properties so you don't lose them. You cannot recover properties lost due to inactivity.
Attempts of trying to hide properties from inactive accounts will not stop you from losing them.

!!! example "Info note"
    The last 2 months of gameplay are always considered the last 2 months before the current month.
    
    So if it is currently April, we will consider the last 2 months of gameplay to be: March + February.

    If we move to May, the last 2 months of gameplay will be: April + March. If we move to June, the last 2 months of gameplay will be: May + April, and so on.

## 2. SA:MP Client, Cheats, Mods, Bugs and Advertising

### The SA:MP Client
We recommend using the official SA:MP client for desktop available for download on [b-zone.ro/samp.](https://b-zone.ro/samp)

Using third party unofficial clients is allowed on your own accord, but we are not responsible for the possible punishments you may receive because of certain bugs/options these may have.

All server deals will be made using the /trade command. Deals made without using this command may lead to scams and you risk remaining without your goods.

!!! example "Info note"

## 8. Website

Server proofs must include the server markings with the date, hours, name of the player and name of the server, except for rule breaking that consist of bans lasting 14 days or more (<span style="color:red;">complaint automatically rejected</span>).

A proof is valid for 3 days at most and must be owned by the person opening the complaint, exception for admins, cheats, illegal business, forbidden mods or other severe rule breaking (<span style="color:red;">complaint automatically rejected</span>).

Falsifying proofs is strictly forbidden (<span style="color:red;">punishment: ban permanent from first offence, no unban at second offence</span>). We will also ban the higher level accounts of the player.

Evidence should preferably be presented without using page-up, in order to accurately interpret the situation. Depending on the case, these pieces of evidence may be taken into consideration, but there is also a risk of them being ignored if they are unclear.
We accept concrete evidence outside the server, video preferred, for complaints regarding illegal businesses, account hacking, vulgar comments, staff complaints (leader, helper, admin) or other severe rule breaking.​

For browser proofs we accept only videos where there is a minimum of one refresh to the page to prove that there is nothing falsified (<span style="color:red;">complaint automatically rejected</span>).

!!! example "Info note"
    The rules above apply also to deleted comments, withdrawn complaints, added witnesses, proofs posted in complaints, external content (links to other sites) and so on.

??? warning "Pointless complaining and posthunting"
    #### <span style="font-size: 25px !important; color: #ff5500 !important;">Posthunting</span>
    We define a posthunter as a person with ill intent who intentionally seeks even the smallest mistakes or puts another player in very difficult situations in order to report them to the staff, with the ultimate goal of sanctioning them.

    Considering the various situations that may arise through complaints, the server staff is the only authority capable of deciding when a player is attempting posthunting.
