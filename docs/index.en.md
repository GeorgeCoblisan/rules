# B-Zone SA:MP Rules

## 1. Accounts

The owner of an account is always considered to be the possessor of the email address registered on the account. For security reasons make sure you do not lose access to the account's email address, otherwise it is lost.

The staff offers limited help via [the recovery system](https://www.rpg.b-zone.ro/account/recoverAccount) on the RPG website and does not guarantee the recovery of a lost account. We reserve our right to reject recoveries  without offering any reason.

!!! example "Info note"
    All punishments will be given depending on the real level of the player (meaning we will calculate the respect points of the player to determinate their real level).

### Accounts/Goods Businesses
We do not allow businesses or attempts of businesses with real goods for game goods (<span style="color:red;">punishment: permanent ban</span>).

We do not allow businesses or attempts of businesses with gold for game goods (<span style="color:red;">punishment: ban 30 days</span>).

We do not allow businesses or attempts of businesses that involve creating multiple clans and selling them overpriced after they get older than a month (<span style="color:red;">punishment: ban 30 days</span>).

We do not allow businesses or attempts of businesses with accounts for real or game goods (<span style="color:red;">punishment: permanent ban without the right to buy shop unban</span>).

!!! danger "Important"

    The second offence is punished <span style="color:red;">directly with permanent ban without the right to buy shop unban</span>.

    Due to the multitude of players who violate these rules, we reserve the right to hold accountable and sanction transfers or businesses that have no logical reasoning or justification.

### Account Security
The staff does not handle problems regarding hacked accounts, stolen goods, punishments received while your account was hacked and so on. It is your duty to take care of your account or your email address.
Sharing an account with other people may lead to such probems and you risk remaining without an account, goods or get punished because of this.

Recovering a lost account can only be done by [a recovery request](https://www.rpg.b-zone.ro/account/recoverAccount) on the website, by clicking the Sign In button and then on Lost your account. Read the rules that show up carefully when trying to recover an account.

!!! example "Info note"

    Level 4+ admins reserve their right to punish someone who hacks accounts or to help someone with a hacked account if they consider necessary. 

    Attention, admins have absolutely no obligation to punish someone or help you if your account got hacked.

??? warning "Examples of ways your account can get hacked"

    More details on this subject can be found here https://forum.b-zone.ro/contspart/ (to be edited with the info from the forum, no external links)

### Multiple Accounts
You can own multiple accounts, but breaking some rules like: illegal businesses, stealing accounts, cheating, forbidden mods, bug abuse, advertising, scamming, language, toxicity, repeated rule breaking, other severe rule breaking can be punished on all accounts you own.

### Account Sharing
Sharing an account with another person is allowed but will be done <span style="color:red;">on your own accord.</span>

!!! danger "Important"

    For bans of at least 14 days we will punish secondary accounts with a higher level than the banned account when one of these conditions are met:

    - when they share in at least 3 different days common IPs for the last week since the punishment was given.
    - have the same email address and the account has been recently active in-game (past month).
    - at the moment of the punishment share the same IP.

    In certain situations the staff can ban secondary accounts that do not apply in this rule with the approval of a level 6 admin.

It is strictly forbidden for members of the RPG team (leaders, helpers, admins) to share their accounts with other people without informing and discussing with the Supervisor or Manager beforehand. The consequence for breaking this rule is removing you from your position or even banning your account if needed.

### Server Activity
Any method of accumulating hours played, leaving the AFK state, automizing actions for you, etc. (autoclickers, blocking keys, route recording mods or other mods, riding accounts in/on cars, abusing the poker system, etc.). This also means controlling secondary accounts in any way, usually by using mods.

Admins will interract with you directly or indirectly, where it is necessary, in order to ensure that you are actually moving the character in game, and if they determine you broke the rule you will get <span style="color:red;">punished with ban 1 day, or more</span> with the approval of a higher level admin for multiple offenses, as well as deleting certain prizes you might have received.

!!! danger "Important"
    In case of advanced mods (that answer automatically, that send warnings when an admin checks, that auto moves the character, that automates actions in your place, etc.) will receive <span style="color:red;">a higher punishment</span> because the verification process is more complicated. The punishment will be etablished by the admins, depending on the case.

We will no longer accept mocking responses to admins who try to determine if you are active on the account. Our purpose is to make sure that you play fair and respect the systems we offer, so don't complicate things.

We also offer players to check and report other players if they catch them using such methods.

As long as you play normally, you move the account, one at a time and don't use methods to explicitly grow your activity abusively, you shouldn't have any fear and the rules above don't apply to you. They are intended for players that try to explicitly abuse, not players who play normally.

### Inactivity
Players that do not have at least 20 REAL hours played in the last 2 months risk losing their house or shares to all owned businesses (no vehicles).

Players with houses bought from the shop need at least 10 REAL hours in the last 2 months not to lose them.

If you cannot play we suggest selling your properties so you don't lose them. You cannot recover properties lost due to inactivity.
Attempts of trying to hide properties from inactive accounts will not stop you from losing them.

!!! example "Info note"
    The last 2 months of gameplay are always considered the last 2 months before the current month.
    
    So if it is currently April, we will consider the last 2 months of gameplay to be: March + February.

    If we move to May, the last 2 months of gameplay will be: April + March. If we move to June, the last 2 months of gameplay will be: May + April, and so on.

## 2. SA:MP Client, Cheats, Mods, Bugs and Advertising

### The SA:MP Client
We recommend using the official SA:MP client for desktop available for download on [b-zone.ro/samp.](https://b-zone.ro/samp)

Using third party unofficial clients is allowed on your own accord, but we are not responsible for the possible punishments you may receive because of certain bugs/options these may have.

!!! danger "Important"
    Registering an account within the server implies your obligation to adhere to the imposed regulations.

    The rules aim to maintain an enjoyable game for everyone and cannot encompass all situations in which someone might disrupt the game, which is why we reserve the right to make <strong>exceptions.</strong>

    If you have questions about situations not explicitly addressed in the regulations, you can contact us by opening a [ticket](https://www.rpg.b-zone.ro/ticket). Arbitrary interpretation of the regulations to gain unfair advantages is not permitted.
